# TrainScheduler
https://tinedanzer.github.io/TrainScheduler/

This app was created in order to store Train schedules into a database, using firebase and Moment.js.

The manager puts the train schedules into the form, clicks submit. Without refreshing the page, the data is 
stored in the server for everyone to see.
