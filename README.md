# TrainScheduler
https://tinedanzer.github.io/TrainScheduler/

This app was created in order to store Train schedules into a real-time database, using firebase and Moment.js.

The manager puts the train schedules into the form, clicks submit. Without refreshing the page, the data is 
stored in the server for everyone to see.
The times should be updated to current.
